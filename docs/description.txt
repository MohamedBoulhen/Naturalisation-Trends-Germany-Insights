Dataset Description: 
The dataset contains information about naturalisation trends in Germany, including the numbers of naturalised citizens, their countries of origin, gender distribution, length of residence in Germany, and regional differences.


Project Focus:
The project is centered around the examination of various dimensions of naturalisation in Germany, with a focus on the following key questions:

1.	Evolution of Naturalisation Numbers:
This section entails the analysis of historical data on naturalisation numbers in Germany to discern trends over time. By tracing the evolution of naturalisation numbers, the project aims to provide insights into how the process of becoming a naturalised citizen has evolved over the years.

2.	Origins of Naturalised Citizens:
Investigating the countries or regions that contribute the most naturalised citizens to Germany forms the core of this section. By identifying the top regions of origin for naturalised citizens, the project seeks to gain a deeper understanding of migration patterns and international relations.

3.	Gender Disparities among Naturalisers:
This section delves into exploring potential gender differences among naturalised citizens. By examining gender-related variations, the project aims to uncover any disparities or biases in the naturalisation process, thereby shedding light on gender dynamics within the immigrant population.

4.	Distribution across Age Groups:
Analysis of data to determine the distribution of naturalised citizens across different age brackets constitutes the focus of this section. Insights derived from this analysis will provide valuable information about age demographics and potential patterns related to life stages or immigration trends.

5.	Distribution across Age Groups and Genders:
This section involves a deeper dive into the data by examining the combined distribution of naturalised citizens across age groups and genders. By exploring these dimensions concurrently, the project aims to uncover more nuanced insights about the composition and characteristics of the naturalised population.

6.	Regional Disparities in Naturalisation:
The final section of the project concentrates on identifying the German states with the highest number of naturalised citizens. By highlighting regional differences, the project aims to underscore areas where integration and diversity play significant roles, offering insights into the socio-cultural landscape of different regions within Germany.
